# Convert and Optimize ESPNet-C with OpenVINOâ„¢

[ESPNet repository](https://github.com/sacmehta/ESPNet)

This tutorial explains how to convert the ESPNet PyTorch model to ONNX and OpenVINO IR with OpenVNO and run the models.


## Notebook Contents

This notebook conrtains a full guide on how to use ESPNet-C version in Pytorch format, convert ESPNet to ONNX and OpenVINO IR format and run inference on them.

The tutorial consists of the following steps:
- Prerequisites
- Import necessary packages
- Load ESPNEt-C model and test inference on it
- Convert PyTorch model to ONNX
- Convert ONNX model to OpenVINO IR
- Run inference on ONNX and OpenVINO IR models and display inference runtime
- Visualize results from 3 models for comaprison

## Installation Instructions
